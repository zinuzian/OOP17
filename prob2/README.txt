This program is compiled by Visual Studio 2013 on Windows7. 

*** How to compile & build
1. Please open solution file. (prob2\prob2.sln)
2. Press Ctrl + F7

Now program is builded. You can find prob2.exe on the directory prob2\Debug
file1.txt is on the directory prob2\prob2\ and prob2\Debug

In command line, you should go to 
YOUR_PATH\prob2\Debug\ and input "prob2.exe file1.txt"


********
Actually I set my project's command line argument as "file1.txt", 
so you can directly check my program.


Enjoy!
